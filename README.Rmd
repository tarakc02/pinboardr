# pinboardr

An R client application for the Pinboard API. Work in progress.

## Usage

So far the `posts` and `tags` endpoints described in the [pinboard documentation](https://pinboard.in/api/) have been implemented. See `?posts` or `?tags` for documentation of the individual functions. 

```{r, cache = TRUE}
library(pinboardr)

# see dates and counts of bookmarks with the "rstats" tag.
rstats_bookmarks <- posts$dates(tags = "rstats")
head(rstats_bookmarks)

# available endpoints
ls(posts)
ls(tags)
```
